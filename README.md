# NY Times News Reader

## Overview
**NY Times News Reader** is a website that allows for a user to view a selection of top news stories from the [New York Times API Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview). The user can view brief information about these stories in a grid format. They can then click on one story to find out more information and be linked to the actual article. The website also gives the user options to filter top stories by certain topics. It is available for use on mobile devices, tablets, and computers.
